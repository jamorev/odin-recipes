            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours.  You can use just soy sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want. Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin. </li>
                <li> Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through. </li>
                <li> Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them.  Bring to a boil and cover with a lid. It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs.  Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool. </li>
                <li> While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring it to a simmer. You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste. </li>
                <li> Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles.  Do NOT add in the flavor packets.  Let that cook. </li>
                <li> Now, we cut up all the toppings!  Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork,  kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices. </li>
                <li> Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori. </li>
            </ol>
