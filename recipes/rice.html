            <h2>Rice</h2>
            <p> Goes well with almost every meal, and is eaten around the world. </p>

            <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Short grain white rice</li>
                <li> Water</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Rinse the rice.  You’ll need to do this several times.  Just put the rice (for most dishes, I use 1 cup of rice) into a bowl, add some water, and stir it around with your hands.  You’ll notice the water ends up kind of murky–that’s all just starch.  Then, strain the rice, and rinse it again.  Keep doing this until the water gets to be mostly clear. </li>
                <li> Strain the rice once last time, and place it in the pot you’ll be cooking it in. </li>
                <li> Add two times the amount of water as there is rice–for example, 1 cup of rice means 2 cups of water, 1 ½ cups of rice means 3 cups of water.  Then just let the rice soak in there for at least a hour. </li>
                <li> Now we cook the rice!  If you’re using a rice cooker, just put the rice and water into the rice cooker and set to cook.  If not, were going to use the 5-5-5 rule to cook it. </li>
                <li> Turn the stove top up to high and let the water come to a boil.  Once it does, turn the heat down to medium, and let it sit there for 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> Turn the heat down to very low, and let it sit there for 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> Then, turn the stove top off, and let it sit for another 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> If the rice is still a little too moist, stir the rice a bit, and then put the rice back on low heat without the lid for a few more minutes, until the rice is to your liking. </li>
            </ol>
